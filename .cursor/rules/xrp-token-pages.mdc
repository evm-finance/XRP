Steps
1)	Start with the current token pages in use for EVM.Finance
2)	Remove the interfaces to Uniswap and Aave
3)	In the location of the Aave/Uniswap display, add the XRP screener fields, create 2 lines in this section.  The top line will have Issuer Name and Issuer Address, this will be the full address no …   Also add a copy icon so the Issuer Address can be copied.   The second row will have the same fields as XRP screener line minus the issuer name and address
4)	At the bottom, show the transactions for the connected wallet, also include a link for the hash address to link to transaction summary, for example https://evm.finance/xrp-explorer/tx/E0C1D4B24D76B4180D2C96450438A0BE14304E69EDFBE91DF6211C923B344401
5)	Need the ability to show prices in USD, in addition to XRP price.
