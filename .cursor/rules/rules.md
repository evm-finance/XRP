Task: Iterate through xrp task list items.  

I would like to proceed with executing the items in task-progress.mdc.

You should look at the task list, come up with a solution for the next task in the list, complete the task, mark it as completed and move on to the next one.  Provide a summary of what has been executed and which files shall be changed.

**Documentation Rule:**
Whenever you come across any file in the system, add or update a summary and comments for that file in app/MASTER_XRP_DOCUMENTATION.md.

Always proceed immediately and continue with the next step.

Before writing any new files from scratch, look through the existing xrp files, and see what is already completed of tasks in the list.
