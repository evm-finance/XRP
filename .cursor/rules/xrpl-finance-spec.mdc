Pool creation for nonXRP pairings
 

Token Pages for XRP Steps 
1) Start with the current token pages in use for EVM.Finance
2) Remove the interfaces to Uniswap and Aave 
3) In the location of the Aave/Uniswap display, add the XRP screener fields, create 2 lines in this section. The top line will have Issuer Name and Issuer Address, this will be the full address no … Also add a copy icon so the Issuer Address can be copied. The second row will have the same fields as XRP screener line minus the issuer name and address 
4) At the bottom, show the transactions for the connected wallet, also include a link for the hash address to link to transaction summary, for example https://evm.finance/xrp-explorer/tx/E0C1D4B24D76B4180D2C96450438A0BE14304E69EDFBE91DF6211C923B344401
5) Need the ability to show prices in USD, in addition to XRP price.
Wallet Integration Improvement
1)    Do not require the user to “Connect to Wallet” at the beginning. Only when they initiate Connect to Wallet or press an action button
2)    Ability to support different wallet addresses for multiple blockchains (EVM and XRP)
XRP Block Reader
1)    Need to add block summary records.  Summary buckets will be for 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hour, 12 hour and 24 hours.
2)    Each bucket will only be for that specific time period.  For example, the active 5 minute record will be for a duration of 1 to 300 seconds before it becomes a historical record on the even 5 minute interval. 
3)    An important item in each bucket is the 5 most traded cryptos during that time. Maybe with Start price and end price on each line with the volume for that time period.
4)    Dedicated page for Summary Records, with a link from the Block Reader
5)    Modify the block reader page to display the active 5 minute record, replacing the “events Composition last 5 minutes”

XRP Balances and Transactions
1)    GEM Wallet integration
2)    XRP balances and transactions on current balances and transaction pages
3)    XRP Balances on Screener page
4)    User can select which blockchains that want displayed. OR we order them automatically from highest to lowest

The summary records provide a quick overview of the blockchain activity for a given time period. Generally, traders want to know which tokens have the highest activity and volume during that time frame. 
1.	Block records will provide a summary of the leading cryptocurrencies that traded during that interval. Block records will exist for 5 minute, 15 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour, 4 hour and 24 hours.
2.	There will be a separate page for all 6 block summary records.
3.	The live block summary will be updates as blocks are read, and will be updated every minute.
4.	Each block summary will display the 5 most actively trading cryptos, with volume and order count.
5.	The main XRP-Explorer page will have the live 5 minute summary record displayed
6.	Past summary records older than 10 time intervals will not be saved.
7.	All saved records will be on even time intervals, for example 5-minute records will be from 0:00 to 4:59.
