        refers to sorting the cryptocurrencies by market cap from greatest to least. The rankings are not an endorsement
        nor are they meant to entice you to take any sort of action. The coin ranking and coin listings are drawn
        directly from cryptocurrency exchanges, publicly available information from commercial-use APIs. EVMX does not
        generate ranking data. EVMX does not endorse or rate any cryptocurrencies listed or mentioned on our site, nor
        do we encourage or solicit you to invest in any cryptocurrency. Trading cryptocurrencies is considered a
        high-risk activity and EVMX strongly encourages you to perform due diligence before considering any trading.
