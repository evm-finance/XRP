      <h4 class="text-h6 mt-6">What is DeFi?</h4>
      <p>
        Back in 2016 many traders considered Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets as the “Wild Wild West”. Fast
        forward to 2020, Bitcoin has increased in price from $500 to $15,500 (11/6/20) while being the best performing
        asset class during this time period. Today the “Wild Wild West” tag is being given to a cryptocurrency offshoot
        called “DeFi”. DeFi is an abbreviation for Decentralized Finance. While the blockchain uses multiple nodes to
        verify transactions, Defi takes it one step further relying on Decentralized applications (Dapps) using both the
        blockchain and smart contracts. Ethereum is the leader in smart contract development, so the majority of DeFi
        Dapps today are built on the Ethereum blockchain. The overall goal of DeFi is providing financial systems that
        are permission-less, which includes systems that lend/borrow, trade cryptocurrency, provide insurance, and price
        oracles as well as other financial functions. This DeFi video from Finematics, provides an overview of DeFi and
        its product landscape.

      <h4 class="text-h6 mt-6">What is a DEX?</h4>
      <p>
        An important concept is comparing centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges (DEX). The first stock
        exchange dates back to 1653 (Amsterdam Stock Exchange) and started out as a public meeting location. This
        phenomena expanded worldwide, today most major countries have their own centralized stock exchange. These
        exchanges now use a computerized “order book” matching engine where all buy and sell orders are routed. The
        first cryptocurrency exchanges followed the order book model. So if you trade Bitcoin on Binance, for example,
        there is a single dedicated order book that lists every buy and sell organized by price level. A decentralized
        exchange (DEX) uses the blockchain to facilitate the meeting of buyers and sellers. Specifically there is no
        central location or single order book the trade transaction needs to route. This recommended video is from
        Crypto Wendy O, providing more details and the benefits reviewing a DEX exchange

      <h4 class="text-h6 mt-6">What is MetaMask?</h4>
      <p>
        As mentioned in the Crypto Wendy O video you need to use a software cryptocurrency wallet to connect to a
        Decentralized Exchange. The most popular wallet today for interfacing to a DEX exchange is MetaMask. MetaMask is
        a software Ethereum wallet that is a browser plugin storing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. With MetaMask you
        control your private keys (make sure you write down your seed phrase on paper, save it in secure locations and
        do not share this with anybody) and have the ability to send and receive the cryptocurrency you have stored
        there.
      </p>
      <p>The next recommended video, by ConsenSysMedia, provides a quick overview of how to use MetaMask.</p>

      <h4 class="text-h6 mt-6">Basic review of Uniswap?</h4>
      <p>
        Today the leading DEX exchange is Uniswap The next video by Boxmining, provides the basic details in “Uniswap
        Guide with Advanced Tips and Tricks”. This includes how to buy and sell, reviews Ethereum gas fees, slippage and
        slippage tolerance along with risks and advanced tips.

      <h4 class="text-h6 mt-6">DEX goes from unknown to market leader</h4>
      <p>
        We have never seen an exchange go from unknown to a leader in such a short period of time. This usage peaked
        late August 2020, reaching volume levels of 8 billion dollars (Higher monthly volume than Coinbase). Data from
        Dune Analytics Up to this point we have only reviewed basic functionality of Uniswap, however the reason Uniswap
        has gotten extremely popular is due to its liquidity providing options.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-h6 mt-6">Yield Farming is the reason for the DEX Boom</h4>
      <p>
        Yield Farming is definitely the buzz word for 2020, to understand what yield farming is you need to know about
        how liquidity is provided to DEX exchanges. Earlier I spoke about how the order book is the centralized function
        used by stock and centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Significantly the leading DEX exchanges do not use a
        centralized order book, instead they rely on cryptocurrency owners to be liquidity providers. DEX exchanges rely
        on liquidity pools governed by automated market makers. Traders are always able to make a transaction with the
        pool provided by cryptocurrency token pair owners. It is necessary to know how liquidity providers are the
        backbone of UniSwap and other DEX exchanges. This video, by Finematics, review explains how DEX exchanges use
        liquidity pools instead of a centralized order book and why.

      <h4 class="text-h6 mt-6">An Advanced Passive Income Strategy</h4>
      <p>
        The prior video touched the benefits for cryptocurrency owners to provide liquidity for the tokens they own. The
        next video is groundbreaking. Published on May 31st 2020, by a mostly unknown Youtuber “denome”, who had fewer
        than 1,000 subscribers at the time (over 20,000 now). Since then over 75,000 views have occurred with an
        explosion of trading volume UniSwap two months later. Was this video alone the reason for the volume surge at a
        mostly unknown DEX exchange, it's hard to say. However this is the first video from a trader making money by
        being a liquidity provider. He reviews his strategy of collecting fees. He reviews the earning method and the
        risks to know.
      </p>

      ></p>

      <p>
        In summary, the important risks are impermanent loss and the exchange being hacked. Since this video was made,
        the term “Yield Farming” has been used to describe the action of being a liquidity provider. Additionally, know
        that the term “wrapped” is used to describe a cryptocurrency that is included in a smart contract. So Wrapped
        Bitcoin is a token matching the price of Bitcoin that is included in a smart contract. The following video from
        BitBoy Crypto provides a nice summary and touches upon some vital details
